# Qiskit-FallFest-Mexico-IBM-Hackathon-Challenge
Our proposal is to implement, throughout VQA, the optimum water distribution network,taking into account the critical zone in order to simulate the network distribution
system for the first ring in the metropolitan area.

This project could be scaled in the future in the early phases of projects planning. Also for local, district zones or any other cities with water scarcity problems.

The nodes were obtained from pipe nodes coordinates and node edges are the separation between the nodes. For simplicity only one water source (node 0) was taken into account.
Scope:
-To apply sectorization with MAX-CUT.
-To optimize the length for the distrubution system.
